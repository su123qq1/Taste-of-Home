                    <div class = "decor"> 
                        <p><em>Jiaozi</em> is the formal name of Chinese dumplings. They are popular major dishes in China and in some East Asian countries, but each country name them differently. For example, Korean dumplings are called <em>Mandu</em>, Janpese dumplings are called <em>Gyoze</em>, and Vietnamese dumplings are called <em>Banh Bot Loc</em>. </p>
                        <p>There are two special times in which Chinese people eat <em>Jiaozi</em>. One is Winter Solstice, also called Dongzhi Festival; another one is Lunar New Year's Eve. Regarding its symbolic meaning in China, <em>Jiaozi</em> represents "happy family reunion" and "good luck" in the upcoming year. It also means the change between the old and the new. Usually, it is served with a vinegar dipping sauce. </p>
