Marinate the shrimp with sesame oil, salt, cornstarch, and white pepper. Combine rice flour, wheat starch, cornstarch, and salt. Add water and stir for 3 minutes. Pre-boil water in steamer. Place the shrimp on a plate, and steam them for 2 minutes. Lift the soaking wet cotton cloth out of the water and line the bottom of the pan with it. With the water in the steamer boiling, use the plate gripper and lower the pan into the steamer. Cover the lid and steam on high for 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the steamer. Lift the cloth out of the pan, and place onto the oiled surface. Scrape the rice noodle sheet off the cotton cloth onto the oiled surface. Peel off the cotton cloth. Cut the rice noodle in half crosswise and line up four cooked shrimp. Roll the rice sheet to wrap up the shrimp. Cut each roll in half, and drizzle with the sauce.
